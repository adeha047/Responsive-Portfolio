# Responsive-Portfolio
I created three different pages to display who I am. 
I used bootstrap to add new dynamics to each html tab. 
I used CSS to style my html. 
I used bootstrap flex to properly display and format the html on the webpage. 
I was mindful of the screen sizes/media queries by adding sizing to the column for large, medium and small screens.
